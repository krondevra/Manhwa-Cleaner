# Decisions
Record of the notable decisions made while merging the three original
repositories into this one (see `history.md` for why they existed
separately in the first place).

## Merge order and method
- Merged in order: gen1 (`1.ML-Cleaner`) → gen2 (`2.Manhwa-Production`)
  → gen3 (`3.Manhwa-cleaner`).
- Built as one linear rebase, not merge commits: each repository's own
  commits were replayed on top of the previous one's tip, so file paths
  accumulate the way they actually did (old prototype files persist as
  history rather than being deleted at the seams).

## Commit versioning scheme
- All commits renumbered to `N.XX.YY`: `N` = generation (1/2/3), `XX` =
  feature number within that generation, `YY` = version of that feature.
  Later simplified from zero-padded (`1.09.01`) to unpadded (`1.9.1`,
  `1.10.1`).
- For gen1, the mapping came directly from the project's existing
  semver-like tags (`v0.1.0`, etc). For gen2/gen3, which had no descriptive
  commit messages at all, feature/version grouping was inferred from diff
  content and commit adjacency.

## File collapsing
- Gen1's separately-numbered file versions were collapsed into single
  evolving files (`remove_manhwa_bg.py`, `cleaner.py`), so history shows
  real diffs between versions instead of separate files sitting side by
  side.

## Data and model removal
- All training-related data (Threshold/ sample PNGs, parameter-search
  reports, evaluation CSVs) and trained model checkpoints (`models/*.pt`,
  `*.json`, versions 1.0-2.1) were removed from every commit in history.
  Reason: those models were trained on copyrighted manhwa chapters; the
  project is moving to an open, reproducible dataset instead. The code that
  produced them was kept.
- `.gitignore` updated afterward so regenerated `models/` and `reports/`
  stay untracked going forward.

## Identity and attribution
- All commit author/committer identity unified to a single name/email,
  replacing the mixed identity used across the original repositories.
- No AI co-authorship or attribution appears anywhere in the history.

## What was kept as-is
- Superseded prototype files (e.g. root-level `remove_manhwa_bg.py`,
  `src/*.py` from gen2) were left in the working tree as historical
  artifacts rather than deleted or archived into a subfolder, to preserve
  the evolution as real, browsable history.

## Which architectural solutions proved successful, and which were discarded
Discarded:
- Pure flood-fill from image edges (v1-v2): destroys white content trapped
  inside frames/speech bubbles once it connects to the edge; the same pixel
  color can be background or content depending on structure alone, which
  flood-fill cannot see.
- Panel detection via black horizontal lines, row-based restore, magic-wand
  imitation (v2-v3): closer to the manual result but still consistently
  worse than a manually cleaned reference; abandoned as a dead end rather
  than kept as "good enough."
- OpenCV Random Trees pixel classifier (v4-v7): trained on a single
  original/cleaned image pair. Looked good only because it exact-copied the
  training image's own alpha channel back out — not evidence of learning.
  Failed on unseen chapters (poor quality, ~11 minutes per chapter) and was
  dropped in favor of real segmentation.

Successful:
- Supervised binary segmentation with a small U-Net (PyTorch), 7-channel
  input: RGB plus threshold/morphological-open/morphological-close/Canny
  guidance channels that directly encode the manual Photoshop workflow this
  project automates (threshold ~90, min/max radius 2px, magic wand). This
  was the actual turning point from "looks plausible" to "generalizes."
- Dataset quality over quantity: the jump from model line 1.x to 2.0 came
  from a few carefully and consistently cleaned chapters, not from adding
  more inconsistent ones.
- Heuristic evaluation without ground truth, used to mine hard cases instead
  of guessing which chapters to add next; an active learning loop (clean →
  train → test on unseen → fix failures → repeat); and semi-automatic
  mask/ROI generation plus Photoshop-style parameter search (separate
  black/white, hard/soft profiles) for hard cases such as black backgrounds.
